### Analysis:
The only significant relationship among the [temperature, cloudiness, humidity, wind] vs latitude plots, is that temperature increases as latitude approaches about 20 degrees. 
Intuition would suggest that temperature should peak at the equator, and trail off from there. However, due to the Earth's tilt on its axis, the relationship is offset to the Northern Hemisphere.
No discernible relationship appears for wind, humidity, nor cloudiness.


### Hemispheres

#### Observations: 
although there is high variance within the error terms (some dots way off the line), the data appear to show linear relationships between latitude and temperature, such that temperature is highest near the equator.  The relationship is more curved (parametric) if both hemispheres are considered together.  The remaining metrics, namely humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed, continue to show no discernible relationship
